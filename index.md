# Privacy Policy for JobAppKit Extension

Last updated: January 1, 2026

## Overview

JobAppKit Extension helps users avoid manual copy-paste by saving Upwork job
details to their application tracker with one click. We only access job page
content when the user clicks "Save Job" and do not collect browsing history.

## Data Accessed

When you click "Save Job" on an Upwork job page, the extension reads:
- Job title and description
- Budget and payment terms
- Client information (country, rating, hire history)
- Required skills
- Job posting URL

Client information is read from the job post page as displayed by Upwork and
used only to save the job record.

The extension also stores local settings:
- API key
- Preferences (e.g., auto-save, debug)

## How Data Is Used

- Job data is sent only to our JobAppKit API to create a saved job record
- Job data is sent only to `https://api.jobappkit.com/`
- Settings are stored locally in the browser and are not sent elsewhere

## Storage and Sharing

- Settings and queued items are stored in Chrome storage on your device
- Saved jobs are retained in the JobAppKit backend until the user deletes them
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising services are used
- Data is not sold or shared with third parties

## Your Choices

- You can clear stored settings in the extension options
- Uninstalling the extension removes local data
- To delete saved jobs, use your JobAppKit backend interface

## Data Portability

- Local settings can be viewed and cleared in Chrome extension storage
- Saved jobs are stored in the JobAppKit backend and can be managed there

## Security

- API keys are stored locally and sent only with the save request
- Requests to `https://api.jobappkit.com` use HTTPS

## Changes

If this policy changes, the "Last updated" date will be revised.
