# Privacy Policy for JobAppKit Extension

Last updated: January 1, 2026

## Overview

JobAppKit Extension helps users avoid manual copy-paste by saving Upwork job
details to their application tracker with one click.

## Data Accessed

When you click "Save Job" on an Upwork job page, the extension reads:
- Job title and description
- Budget and payment terms
- Client information (country, rating, hire history)
- Required skills
- Job posting URL

The extension also stores local settings:
- API key
- Preferences (e.g., auto-save, debug)

## How Data Is Used

- Job data is sent only to `https://api.jobappkit.com/api/v1/jobs/capture/`
- Settings are stored locally in the browser and are not sent elsewhere

## Storage and Sharing

- Settings and queued items are stored in Chrome storage on your device
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising services are used
- Data is not sold or shared with third parties

## Your Choices

- You can clear stored settings in the extension options
- Uninstalling the extension removes local data
- To delete saved jobs, use your JobAppKit backend interface

## Data Portability

- Local settings can be viewed and cleared in Chrome extension storage
- Saved jobs are stored in the JobAppKit backend and can be managed there

## Security

- API keys are stored locally and sent only with the save request
- Requests to `https://api.jobappkit.com` use HTTPS

## Changes

If this policy changes, the "Last updated" date will be revised.
